# About
VCET Essentials is a Hybrid Android app built with Ionic for my college VCET. It was meant as the mini project for our 6th semester.

The motivation for building this was the need to have all of the essential information of our college to be present in one place. I noticed that only some of the important notices like admission dates, fees structure were uploaded in our college website. All other notices including last date of applying for exams were only posted on actual notice board present inside the college. This wasn't a big issue for most of the time but I observed that sometimes an online notice board was desired because of following reasons.
  - Dropout students can get all of the information regarding exams without visiting to college campus regularly.
  - Some notices were only posted to one notice board.
  - Accessing notices digitally was much easier.

# Features

Initially, I thought of building a mobile app for accessing the notices and a website for college admins to upload those notices. But after a while, several features were added. Currently the app has following features.
  - Notice Board : Students can access all of the notices uploaded by college admins. Also details of any event can be uploaded by student bodies.
  - Blog : Various student bodies and departments can upload blogs which users can read.
  - Timetable : Students can see the timetable of every department. They can know which lecture is being conducted in a class by just entering the room number of that class. They can also know whether a particular professor is currently at his office or is teaching in some class.
